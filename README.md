Code developed for my TFG (Final Thesis) - Door opening system triggered by speech recognition

This project implements a system for opening/blocking an electric lock by means of password identification. 
The password will be entered by voice, and transcribed into text using the Google Cloud Speech-to-Text cloud service. 
The hardware platform used is a Raspberry Pi 3B and the programming language chosen to perform the project is Python.
Identification functionality is developed as well as system password modification. 
Regarding the user interaction, 2 LEDs and a buzzer are used as indication to the user, thus using the GPIO pins, 
which are used to connect the Raspberry Pi with sensors or electronic devices.
